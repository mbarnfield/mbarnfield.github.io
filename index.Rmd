I am a political science PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, interested in comparative political behaviour and public opinion. I'm also, predictably, into `R`, as both a user and developer. You can see my full [CV here](https://github.com/mbarnfield/cv/blob/master/cv_files/mgb_cv.pdf). 

My solo-authored article on conceptual issues in research on the 'bandwagon effect' is OnlineFirst at [Political Studies Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1478929919870691). My co-authored research note on why party members quit, with [Tim Bale](https://twitter.com/ProfTimBale), is OnlineFirst at [Party Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1354068820962035). I am also in the process of adapting chapters of my PhD thesis for publication as journal articles. Alongside this I do some software development, including [`cjbae`](https://github.com/mbarnfield/cjbae), an `R` package I'm writing with [Jack Bailey](https://twitter.com/PoliSciJack). 

I graduated from my BA in Modern Languages and European Studies at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk) in 2017, following this with a [Master's degree in Political Research](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-2019/taught-postgraduate-courses/mres-politics-and-international-studies-full-time/). My Master's [dissertation](https://www.bath.ac.uk/library/dissertations/index.php?programme=MRes+Politics+and+International+Studies), supervised by [Peter Allen](http://www.peter-allen.co.uk) and [Aurelien Mondon](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/aurelien-mondon), studied post-decision attitude change among Labour-Conservative vote switchers at the 2017 general election. I joined [SPIR at Queen Mary](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/) in 2018. My PhD supervisors are [Javier Sajuria](http://www.sajuria.com) and [Philip Cowley](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/staff/profiles/cowleyphilip.html).
