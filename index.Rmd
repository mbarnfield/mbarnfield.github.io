I am a political science PhD student at Queen Mary University of London. Broadly, I am interested in comparative political behaviour and public opinion. I'm also, predictably, into `R`, and applying it to methods of causal inference, using both experimental and observational data.     

My first academic article --- a review paper on conceptual issues in research on the 'bandwagon effect' --- is forthcoming at [Political Studies Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/psw). I also have other projects underway, including a paper on causal inference and endogeneity in the relationship between electoral expectations and vote choice, and a collaborative paper with [Jack Bailey](https://twitter.com/poliscijack?lang=en) on the application of Bayesian inference to conjoint experiments. The latter project also has a software output, in the form of our `R` package [`cjbae`](https://github.com/mbarnfield/cjbae) which is very much a work in progress. I dabble in election forecasting and predictive modelling for Fantasy Premier League player scores.    

I graduated from my undergraduate degree in Modern Languages and European Studies at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk) in 2017, following this with a [Master's degree in Political Research](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-2019/taught-postgraduate-courses/mres-politics-and-international-studies-full-time/). My Master's dissertation, supervised by [Peter Allen](http://www.peter-allen.co.uk), studied post-decision attitude change among Labour-Conservative vote switchers at the 2017 general election. I joined [SPIR at Queen Mary](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/) in 2018. My PhD supervisors are [Javier Sajuria](http://www.sajuria.com) and [Philip Cowley](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/staff/profiles/cowleyphilip.html).
