I am a political science PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, interested in comparative political behaviour and public opinion. I'm also, predictably, into `R`, and applying it to methods of causal inference, using both experimental and observational data.      

My first academic article --- a review paper on conceptual issues in research on the 'bandwagon effect' --- is OnlineFirst at [Political Studies Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1478929919870691). I have other projects underway, including a paper on causal inference and endogeneity in the relationship between electoral expectations and vote choice. I'm also working on software, including [`cjbae`](https://github.com/mbarnfield/cjbae), an `R` package I'm writing with [Jack Bailey](https://twitter.com/PoliSciJack). 

I graduated from my BA in Modern Languages and European Studies at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk) in 2017, following this with a [Master's degree in Political Research](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-2019/taught-postgraduate-courses/mres-politics-and-international-studies-full-time/). My Master's [dissertation](https://www.bath.ac.uk/library/dissertations/index.php?programme=MRes+Politics+and+International+Studies), supervised by [Peter Allen](http://www.peter-allen.co.uk) and [Aurelien Mondon](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/aurelien-mondon), studied post-decision attitude change among Labour-Conservative vote switchers at the 2017 general election. I joined [SPIR at Queen Mary](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/) in 2018. My PhD supervisors are [Javier Sajuria](http://www.sajuria.com) and [Philip Cowley](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/staff/profiles/cowleyphilip.html).
