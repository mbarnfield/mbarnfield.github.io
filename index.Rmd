I am a  PhD student in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary University of London, interested in comparative political behaviour and public opinion. You can see my full [CV here](https://github.com/mbarnfield/cv/blob/master/cv_files/mgb_cv.pdf). 

I have written in [Political Studies Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1478929919870691) on conceptual issues in research on the 'bandwagon effect'. My research note on why political party members quit, co-authored with [Tim Bale](https://twitter.com/ProfTimBale), is OnlineFirst at [Party Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1354068820962035). I have also recently collaborated with [Thomas Zerback](https://www.ikmz.uzh.ch/en/department/people/professors/thomas-zerback.html) and [Carsten Reinemann](https://www.en.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/research/chairs/reinemann/index.html) on a study of how well people remember the results of vote intention polls, punlished in [Mass Communication and Society](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15205436.2021.1936559). I am in the process of adapting chapters of my PhD thesis and other working papers for publication as journal articles.  

My doctoral research focuses on the 'bandwagon effect' and related issues involving opinion polls, electoral expectations and voting behaviour. The empirical contributions include experimental studies of how people base their electoral expectations on the momentum parties have in the polls, conjoint experiments on the effect of polls on the vote in the 2020 US presidential election, and a panel study of the bandwagon effect for the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election.    

I graduated from my BA in Modern Languages and European Studies at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk) in 2017, following this with a [Master's degree in Political Research](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-2019/taught-postgraduate-courses/mres-politics-and-international-studies-full-time/). My Master's [dissertation](https://www.bath.ac.uk/library/dissertations/index.php?programme=MRes+Politics+and+International+Studies), supervised by [Peter Allen](http://www.peter-allen.co.uk) and [Aurelien Mondon](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/aurelien-mondon), studied post-decision attitude change among Labour-Conservative vote switchers at the 2017 general election. I joined [SPIR at Queen Mary](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/) in 2018. My PhD supervisors are [Javier Sajuria](http://www.sajuria.com) and [Philip Cowley](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/staff/profiles/cowleyphilip.html).
